# League-Of-Legends-Coach

Personal League of Legends coach. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the project rules.

Phase 1 is data ingestion: Riot ID → PUUID → match IDs → match details and timelines.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.12, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set `RIOT_API_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
   Get a key from the [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com).
   Development keys expire every 24 hours.
2. Start everything: `docker compose up --build -d`. This also applies migrations.

## Sync a player

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8000/sync -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game_name": "yuval34", "tag_line": "34343"}'
curl localhost:8000/sync/status
```

100 matches take about 4 minutes, because each match needs 2 calls and the limit
is 100 calls per 2 minutes. A sync can be run again safely: it fetches only what's
missing.

## Benchmarks

Compare your jungle stats with real Silver and Emerald games:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8000/benchmarks/pull -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cohort": "silver", "max_matches": 500}'
curl localhost:8000/benchmarks/status
curl "localhost:8000/benchmarks/compare?cohort=silver"
curl "localhost:8000/benchmarks/compare?cohort=emerald&champion=Viego"
```

`max_matches` is the cohort's running total, so raise it to carry on. A pull saves
its progress as it goes and can be started again after a key expires. It can't
run alongside a sync, because they share one call budget. Benchmark data stays in
the `benchmark` schema. [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) explains the rules.

After updating `RIOT_API_KEY`, run `docker compose up -d api`. `restart` keeps
the old key.

## Backups

```sh
docker compose up -d db
uv run python scripts/backup.py
```

This writes the whole database to a dated, compressed file in `backups/`, which
git ignores. To restore one into an empty database:

```sh
docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'pg_restore -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d <database>' < backups/<file>.dump
```

## Rate limiting

The limiter uses a sliding window even though Riot counts in fixed windows,
because we can't see when Riot's windows reset, and keeping every span under the
limit is safe wherever they start, at the cost of slightly lower throughput.

Its state lives in memory, so the app must run as a single process.

## Tests

```sh
docker compose up -d db
uv run pytest
```

Tests use a separate `lolcoach_test` database.
